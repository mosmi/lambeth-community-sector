  title: An independent space to support community involvement in Lambeth
story: Lambeth does not have a representative body elected by community and
  voluntary groups. This website aims to create an independent space currently
  promoted by Waterloo Action Centre, Bright, and a few others, to exchange
  information and ideas. And help those who wish to, to work closer together.
